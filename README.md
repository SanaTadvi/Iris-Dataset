# Iris-Dataset

Worked on Iris Dataset which gave me error like-Different column names, Irrelevant Data type, And Irrelevant Variables. The errors were resolved by Renaming the columns, changing the Datatype with the help of "astype", and  replaced the multiple variables in the column withe the help of "replace" functions.
